# Titanic ML Project ðŸ›³

## Overview
This project uses the Titanic dataset to demonstrate:
- Supervised Learning (Logistic Regression) for survival prediction.
- Unsupervised Learning (KMeans Clustering) for grouping passengers.

## Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Train/test split
4. Logistic Regression (Supervised)
5. KMeans Clustering (Unsupervised)
6. Model evaluation and results

## Results
- Logistic Regression achieved good accuracy in predicting survival.
- KMeans clustering grouped passengers into clusters for pattern discovery.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
