BK Birla College
ML Algorithms and Model Building

Instructions:
- All tasks must be submitted on or before the specified deadline.
- Tasks should be submitted strictly in PDF format only.

Task 1: ML Basics - Your First Data Science Project
Objective:
Learn the fundamentals of machine learning by completing a full ML workflow from
data loading to model evaluation. Understand the difference between supervised and
unsupervised learning through hands-on practice.

Reference Datasets:
- Titanic dataset (Kaggle - beginner friendly)
- Iris dataset (built into sklearn)
- Boston Housing dataset (built into sklearn)

Approach:
1. Load the Titanic dataset using pandas
2. Explore the data with basic statistics and visualizations
3. Handle missing values (simple fill or drop methods)
4. Split data into training and testing sets (80/20)
5. Try both supervised (predict survival) and unsupervised (group passengers) tasks
6. Use sklearn libraries for basic models
7. Evaluate results with simple accuracy scores
8. Document the complete ML workflow

Deliverables:
- Jupyter notebook with complete workflow
- Basic data visualizations (bar charts, histograms)
- Simple model predictions
- One-page summary of supervised vs unsupervised learning

Evaluation Criteria:
- Can you load and explore data successfully?
- Do you understand train/test split concept?
- Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
- Is the workflow clear and documented?
